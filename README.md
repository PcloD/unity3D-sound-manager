unity-sound-manager
===================

This is a simple script to manage one shot sounds in unity.


How To?
-------------

> - Attach this script to any GameObject (MainCamera, EmptyGameObject, etc.);
> - Put your sounds in the script inspector within Unity3D;
> - Add an audio source to any GameObject (strongly recommended to add to the same GameObject as the sound manager script);
> - When you need to call the one shot sound simply add: Sounds.PlaySound (SoundsGame.sound1) in any script (i.e.: EnemyHit) changing "sound1" to desired;
